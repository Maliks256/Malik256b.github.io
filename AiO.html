[00:26.58] 'Cause it was always you (alright)
[00:30.83] And if I'm turning blue, please don't save me
[00:35.62] Nothing left to lose without my baby
[00:41.67] Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know
[00:46.27] I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
[00:50.94] Can't change the weather, might not be forever
[00:54.66] But if it's forever, it's even better
[00:59.92] And I don't know what I'm crying for
[01:04.96] I don't think I could love you more
[01:09.18] It might not be long, but baby, I
[01:15.46] I'll love you 'til the day that I die
[01:20.76] 'Til the day that I die
[01:25.44] 'Til the light leaves my eyes
[01:30.05] 'Til the day that I die
[01:35.00] I want you to see, hm
[01:39.78] How you look to me, hm
[01:44.25] You wouldn't believe if I told ya
[01:48.79] You would keep the compliments I throw ya
[01:53.23] But you're so full of shit, uh
[01:57.99] Tell me it's a bit, oh
[02:02.51] Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
[02:07.06] Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid
[02:12.96] And I don't know what I'm crying for
[02:18.07] I don't think I could love you more
[02:22.22] Might not be long, but baby, I
[02:29.16] Don't wanna say goodbye
[02:31.34] Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know ('til the day that I die)
[02:35.93] I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone ('til the light leaves my eyes)
[02:40.44] Can't change the weather, might not be forever ('til the day that I die)
[02:44.31] But if it's forever, it's even better
[02:49.80] I knew you in another life
[02:54.52] You had that same look in your eyes
[02:59.52] I love you, don't act so surprised
